# Welcome to Rails-aide

## Motivation

Rails-aide came about through the need to automate certain tasks when dealing with modern Rails apps (in particular one project) where there was a very definite format for frontend Vue files which became labourious to keep creating the same files over and over.

I hope to extend this tool for a more generic workflow in the future.
