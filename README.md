# mscmgmt-builder

A small command line utility for automating file creation and other helpers in a Rails app with Vue on the front end.

Currently specific to the mscmgmt webapp.

## TODO

* Write generated files to directory rather than where the binary is run.
* Piggy back running rails commands - involves storing model attributes and generate the rails command
* Better config using a local file to overwrite the default if present (Viper)
* More involved templates including imports, mixins etc.
* Make it more generic for other Rails apps. Possible rename to 'railsgo'
